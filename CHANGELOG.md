## [0.1.5] - 2018-03-??

- Changed child-elements of panel from `<div class="panel-header">` and `<div class="panel-footer">` to `<header>` and `<footer>` (utility-classes, like `.panel-heading-right`, still apply).
- Changed child-elements of modal from `<div class="modal-header">` and `<div class="panel-footer">` to `<header>` and `<footer>` (utility-classes, like `.panel-heading-right`, still apply).

## [0.1.3] - 2018-03-08

### Added

- Added central configuration for routes, routes are now added dynamically when configured in `./src/App/routes/`.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.MD`.
- Added Contributing documentation component under `GettingStarted`.
- Added stylelint to project.
- Added configuration files for stylelint (`.stylelintrc` and `.stylelintignore`).

### Changed

- Changed routing logic, so that routes are now configured in the `router` directory under `App`. To add new routes simply add it to the routes array in the appropriate object. `root.js` is the four main routes, `docs.js` contains the routes for the documentation. Will add routes for examples and templates (and maybe home) when needed.
- Changed `SelectPanel` so that is now updated with the routes from `/routes/docs.js` and not from the separate adjacent `routes.js`.
- Changed Button component: Renamed prop `color` to `type`, the previous prop `type` has been renamed `btnType`.
- Changed prop `type` on Alert and Button component from `PropTypes.string` to `PropTypes.oneOf` (enum).
- Changed `npm` scripts to contain linting by stylelint

### Removed

- Removed obsolete index files from `Components`, `Core` and `GettingStarted` directories under `Documentation`, these files almost exclusively handled routing.
- Removed separate `routes.js` file from `SelectPanel` directory.
- Removed `DocView` component.

### Changed

- The alert component's close button now no longer needs `data-close` attribute to close the alert, only `.alert-close` class is needed.
